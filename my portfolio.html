                <p>Hi, I'm Muu.I'm from Kanazawa.I'm a first year student of International College of Technology,Kanazawa. This website shows about my engineering projects. Also you can see about my favorite movies from "My Favorite!".

                <p>This is my STEM project in 2019. I reserched Storm glass. It is the weather forcus tool. The purpose of this project is to know why it can predict weather after 6~12 hours,and to know the accuracy of the weather it predicts. 
				   This projects was interesting because I could see different crystals every day. However, it was difficult to summarize detas. I want to study more!!

                <h1>Worst Design</h3>

                <p>This is my project of Enginnering Design IA. The lid of pens case was the worst design in my daily life.It was inconvenience. I thought the lid is to small. So I decided to make it bigger.

                <p>My solution was to eliminate the gaps. There were gaps. So I made new lid without gaps. I used 3Dprinter to make that. To use 3Dprinter was difficult because I had to design exactly. First prototype was too small, and 2nd protopype was too big.
   				   I could make it in the third time. I could to make it very well. Now I use it in daily life!!
